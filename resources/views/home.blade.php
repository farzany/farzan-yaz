            <p class="body">
                I'm a third year student at McMaster University studying Computer Science. I did Software Engineering for my first two years, but realized I prefer the CS curriculum, instead. I am currently passionate about discovering and automating time-consuming, repetitive tasks. For more information about my academic career, please visit my LinkedIn profile!

                In under 100 words: I have 3000 hours on CSGO, which basically makes me a professional gamer. I love biking through trails and the city. I find photography relaxing and post my favorite shots on my Instagram page. I'm a big fan of the MCU with Iron Man as my favorite! I'm always listening to music - my favorite album is Get Rich or Die Trying by 50 Cent. I'm a Cryptocurrency connoisseur. I'm fairly skilled with video and photo editing which has come from my brief Minecraft YouTube career back in highschool. As one does, I of course also love memes.
